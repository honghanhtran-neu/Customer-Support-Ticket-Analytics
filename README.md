# Customer Support Ticket Analytics

## 1. Business Context
The company operates a *multi-channel customer support system* (including chat, phone, social media, email) to handle technical issues and service requests from customers. Each customer request is logged in the system as a support ticket.
However, the current system lacks visibility in several key areas:
- Overall status and volume of incoming tickets
- Response and resolution speed across channels, products, and issue types
- Satisfaction levels of customers by time, channel, or product
This lack of visibility makes it difficult for the company to *measure performance, identify bottlenecks*, and make data-driven decisions to enhance the customer experience.
