# Customer Support Ticket Analytics

## 1. Business Context
The company operates a **multi-channel customer support system** (including chat, phone, social media, email) to handle technical issues and service requests from customers. Each customer request is logged in the system as a support ticket.
However, the current system lacks visibility in several key areas:
- Overall status and volume of incoming tickets
- Response and resolution speed across channels, products, and issue types
- Satisfaction levels of customers by time, channel, or product
This lack of visibility makes it difficult for the company to **measure performance, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions** to enhance the customer experience.

## 2. Key Business Questions
To support relevant departments such as the **Head of Customer Support, Product Managers**, and the **CRM/Marketing Team** in enhancing their performance and uncovering actionable trends, this project aims to address the following key business questions:

üìå **Operational Performance**
- What is the average time taken to respond to and resolve a ticket?
- What percentage of tickets are resolved within SLA targets?
- Are high-priority tickets actually being prioritized in practice?

‚ö†Ô∏è **Bottlenecks**
- Which support channels tend to have slower response times?
- Are there recurring issues or frequently reported product-related complaints?

üòä **Customer Experience**
- How does customer satisfaction vary across different products, channels, or time periods?
- Can we predict which tickets are at risk of receiving low satisfaction scores?

üìà **Trends and Seasonality**
- Are there specific months with unusually high ticket volumes?
- How has customer behavior changed between 2020 and 2021?
